and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.1] - 2026-09-08
### Fixed
- Temporarily remove Entity Clone until it has a stable release
  ([#3621450](https://www.drupal.org/i/3621450)).
- Temporarily remove Rabbit Hole and Advanced Text Formatter until they have stable
  releases ([#3621492](https://www.drupal.org/i/3621492)).
- Require the released View Modes Inventory 5.0.0 instead of the dev branch
  ([#3621558](https://www.drupal.org/i/3621558)).
### Changed
- Pin the `drupal/varbase_components` dependency to `~4.0.0` for the release.
- Update the version badge to `1.0.1` in `README.md`.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-09-06
### Changed
- First stable release of the Varbase Content Base recipe.
- Pin the `drupal/vmi` dependency to `~5.0.0` and `drupal/varbase_components` to `~4.0.0`
  for the stable release.
- Update the version badge to `1.0.0` in `README.md`.

## [1.0.0-rc4] - 2026-09-02
### Added
- Require the `vardot/aos` library, so the recipe brings the AOS library that
  Varbase Components loads.

### Fixed
- Remove the `edit canvas global regions` permission from the Site Admin role,
  as it is stripped with a warning on a Drupal CMS base.

### Changed
- Pin the `drupal/varbase_components` dependency to `~4.0.0` and `drupal/vmi` to `~5.0.0`
  for the release.
- Update the version badge to `1.0.0-rc4` in `README.md`.

## [1.0.0-rc3] - 2026-09-02
### Added
- Add the `search_index` view mode for nodes (`core.entity_view_mode.node.search_index`),
  which the `drupal_cms_search` recipe imports but does not ship. With Search applied
  after this recipe, creating the view mode here is the correct ordering.

### Changed
- Pin the `drupal/varbase_components` dependency to `~4.0.0` and `drupal/vmi` to `~5.0.0`
  for the release.
- Update the version badge to `1.0.0-rc3` in `README.md`.

## [1.0.0-rc2] - 2026-09-01
### Changed
- Remove the `canvas_override` install and its `drupal/canvas_override` requirement,
  as we moved them to the new `varbase_canvas_base` recipe. The Drupal Canvas
  permission grants stay here, so the roles are unchanged for every site that
  applies this recipe.
- Pin the `drupal/varbase_components` dependency to `~4.0.0` and `drupal/vmi` to `~5.0.0`
  for the release.
- Update the version badge to `1.0.0-rc2` in `README.md`.

## [1.0.0-rc1] - 2026-08-15
### Changed
- Pin the `drupal/varbase_components` to `~4.0.0`, `drupal/canvas_override` to `~1.0.0`, `drupal/vmi` to `~5.0.0` dependencies for the release.
- Update the version badge to `1.0.0-rc1` in `README.md`.

## [1.0.0-beta1] - 2026-07-09
### Changed
- Update Drupal Core from ~11.3.0 to ~11.4.0 in the Varbase Content Base recipe.
- Pin the `drupal/varbase_components` dependency to `~4.0.0`, `drupal/canvas_override` to `~1.0.0`, and `drupal/vmi` to `~5.0.0`.
- Update the version badge to `1.0.0-beta1` in `README.md`.
- Run CI on tag pushes and add the README pipeline and release badges.
